= Arduino Seeed Library for ENGI 1020

This is a library for interacting with the
https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Starter-Kit-for-Arduino-p-1855.html[
  Seeed Studio Grove Starter Kit for Arduino],
as we use in the labs for ENGI 1020: Introduction to Programming.


== Library reference

The
https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Starter-Kit-for-Arduino-p-1855.html[
  Seeed Studio Starter Kit for Android]
comes with a variety of components for you to interact with.
Each requires software interaction, which is supported by the functions in this
library (and the libraries it uses).


=== RGB-backlit LCD screen

The
http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-LCD_RGB_Backlight[RGB-backlit LCD screen]
can display text in two rows of up to 16 characters each,
backlit with an RGB (red-green-blue) LED capable of displaying
16.7M individual colours.
Before the LCD display can be used, you must connect it to an I2C port on the
Grove shield and call the `lcdInit()` function:

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Set up the LCD screen for use.
 *
 * This function must be called before any of the other LCD functions will work.
 */
void lcdInit();
----


==== Backlight

The colour of the backlight can be modified with the `lcdBacklightColour()`
function.
This function allows the amount of red, green and blue light that should be
emitted by the backlight, where each of these (additive) primary colours is
given as an integer in the range [0,255].
You may find
https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp[this colour tool]
helpful when choosing the colour you would like to use.

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Change the colour of the LCD backlight.
 *
 * @param    red      how red the backlight should be: [0,255]
 * @param    green    how green the backlight should be: [0,255]
 * @param    blue     how blue the backlight should be: [0,255]
 */
void lcdBacklightColour(int red, int green, int blue);
----


==== Text

Text is displayed (or cleared!) on the LCD screen using the following functions:

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Clear all text from the LCD display.
 */
void lcdClear();
----

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Print a string to the LCD screen.
 */
void lcdPrint(String);
----


=== Chainable RGBA LED

[float="right", width=300]

Multiple
http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Chainable_RGB_LED[RGBA LEDs]
(red, green, blue and _alpha_, or _brightness_) can be chained
together by connecting one to an I2C port and then connecting several LEDS'
"in" and "out" ports together.
Your first LED-related function call must be to the `rgbLedInit()` function:


[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Prepare the RGB LED chain.
 *
 * @param    digitalPin   pin the chain is connected to (e.g., 4 for D4)
 * @param    count        number of LEDs in the chain
 */
void rgbLedInit(int digitalPin, int count);
----


==== Colour manipulation

Any RGBA LED in the chain can be set to any colour, using either the
http://colorizer.org[HSV or RGB colour models].

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Set the colours emitted by a specific RGB LED in the chain.
 *
 * @param    led          which LED to change   @pre 0 <= led < count
 * @param    hue          colour  @pre 0 <= r <= 1.0
 * @param    saturation   how colourful the colour is  @pre 0 <= r <= 1.0
 * @param    brightness   overall brightness  @pre 0 <= r <= 1.0
 */
void rgbLedHSB(int led, float hue, float saturation, float brightness);
----

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Set the colours emitted by a specific RGB LED in the chain.
 *
 * @param    led     which LED to change   @pre 0 <= led < count
 * @param    red     red component of LED  @pre 0 <= r <= 255
 * @param    green   green component of LED  @pre 0 <= r <= 255
 * @param    blue    blue component of LED  @pre 0 <= r <= 255
 */
void rgbLedRGB(int led, int red, int green, int blue);
