link:{{% ref "../components" %}}[Specialized components] for the Grove kit
require specialized software libraries.
However, generic link:{{% relref "./analog" %}}[analog] and
link:{{% relref "./digital" %}}[digital] components can be used via generic
Arduino library functions such as
`analogRead` and `digitalWrite`.
