includes multiple LEDs that can be turned on or off independently and can be
used to represent a kind of bar graph.

== Hardware

The LED bar should be plugged into a **digital port** on your

== Software

Functions that interact with the LED bar are prefixed with `bar`.


=== Initialization

To prepare the software library to use the LED bar, first call the
`barInit` function, telling it which pin it is connected to:

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Prepare to use an LED bar.
 *
 * @param   pin     the **digital** pin the bar is attached to
 */
void barInit(int pin);
----


=== LED control

There are ten different LEDs on the LED bar. We can control the brightness of each individually or all bars up to a given level/

To light up all bars to a certain level, call `barSetLevel()`:

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Make the LED bar display a level between 0 and 10
 *
 * @param    level        the level to display  @pre 0 <= level <= 10.0
 */
void barSetLevel(float level);
----

To light any individual bar, call `barSetLed()`:

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Set brightness for a single LED in the bar
 *
 * @param    led          which LED to manipulate  @pre 1 <= led <= 10
 * @param    brightness   how bright to make it @pre 0 <= brightness <= 1
 */
void barSetLed(int led, float brightness);
