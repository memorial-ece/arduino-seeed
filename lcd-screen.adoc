The
http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-LCD_RGB_Backlight[RGB-backlit LCD screen]
can display text in two rows of up to 16 characters each,
backlit with an RGB (red-green-blue) LED capable of displaying
16.7M individual colours.

== Hardware

Plug the LCD screen into any of the I2C ports on your
https://www.seeedstudio.com/Base-Shield-V2-p-1378.html[Grove shield]:

== Software

Functions that interact with the LCD screen are prefixed with `lcd`.


=== Initialization

Before the LCD display can be used, you must connect it to an I2C port on the
Grove shield and call the `lcdInit()` function:

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Set up the LCD screen for use.
 *
 * This function must be called before any of the other LCD functions will work.
 */
void lcdInit();
----

This tells the software library that you are using an LCD screen and that you
have plugged in into an I2C port.
You must call this function before anything else will work.


=== Backlight control

The colour of the backlight can be modified with the `lcdBacklightColour()`
function.
This function allows the amount of red, green and blue light that should be
emitted by the backlight, where each of these (additive) primary colours is
given as an integer in the range [0,255].
You may find

helpful when choosing a colour.

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Change the colour of the LCD backlight.
 *
 * @param    red      how red the backlight should be: [0,255]
 * @param    green    how green the backlight should be: [0,255]
 * @param    blue     how blue the backlight should be: [0,255]
 */
void lcdBacklightColour(int red, int green, int blue);

=== Text output

Text is displayed (or cleared!) on the LCD screen using the following functions.
Unlike the console in a conventional {cpp} program, the newline character
(`\n`) has no effect on this LCD screen.
Instead, we need to control the cursor location explicitly.

To erase the screen's current contents and reset the cursor to the top-left
of the screen, call `lcdClear()`:

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Clear all text from the LCD screen and reset the cursor to the top-left
 * of the screen.
 */
void lcdClear();
----

To output text to the screen, pass an integer or a string to one of the
`lcdPrint` functions:

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Print a string to the LCD screen.
 *
 * @note    not available in Lab 1 library
 */
void lcdPrint(int);

/**
 * Print a string to the LCD screen.
 *
 * @param    message   the text to print to the LCD screen, starting from the
 *                     current cursor location
 */
void lcdPrint(String message);
----

You can move the cursor (from which new printing will happen) to any location
on the screen using the `lcdMoveCursor` function:

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Move the cursor to a specific location.
 *
 * @param    int x
 * @param    int y
 *
 * @note    not available in Lab 1 library
 */
void lcdMoveCursor(int x, int y);
