== Hardware

These LEDs (light-emitting diodes) have four control channels:
Red, Green, Blue and _Alpha_ (brightness).
Multiple
http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Chainable_RGB_LED[RGBA LEDs] can be chained
together by connecting one to an I2C port and then connecting several LEDS'
"in" and "out" ports together.

== Software

Functions that interact with the RGBA LEDs are prefixed with `rgbLed`.

=== Initialization

Your first LED-related function call must be to the `rgbLedInit()` function:

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Prepare the RGB LED chain.
 *
 * @param    digitalPin   pin the chain is connected to (e.g., 4 for D4)
 * @param    count        number of LEDs in the chain
 */
void rgbLedInit(int digitalPin, int count);
----

This tells the software library to which digital pin you have connected the LED
chain and how many LEDs are in that chain.
This information is necessary for the library to control the individual LEDs
properly.


=== Colour manipulation

Any RGBA LED in the chain can be set to any colour, using either the
http://colorizer.org[HSV or RGB colour models].

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Set the colours emitted by a specific RGB LED in the chain.
 *
 * @param    led          which LED to change   @pre 0 <= led < count
 * @param    hue          colour  @pre 0 <= r <= 1.0
 * @param    saturation   how colourful the colour is  @pre 0 <= r <= 1.0
 * @param    brightness   overall brightness  @pre 0 <= r <= 1.0
 */
void rgbLedHSB(int led, float hue, float saturation, float brightness);

/**

 *
 * @param    led     which LED to change   @pre 0 <= led < count
 * @param    red     red component of LED  @pre 0 <= r <= 255
 * @param    green   green component of LED  @pre 0 <= r <= 255
 * @param    blue    blue component of LED  @pre 0 <= r <= 255
