 integrates gesture recognition function with general I2C interface into a single chip. It can recognize 9 basic gestures, and these gestures information can be simply accessed via the I2C bus.You can use Gesture as an input device to control another grove, or a computer, mobile phone, smart car, robot, and more with a simple swipe of your hand.

== Hardware

Plug the sensor into any of the I2C ports on your

== Software

Functions that interact with the barometer are prefixed with `gesture`.


=== Initialization

Before the gesture sensor can be used, you must connect it to an I2C port on the
Grove shield and call the `gestureInit()` function:

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Set up the gesture sensor for use.
 *
 * This function must be called before the sensor will work.
 */
void bmpInit();
----

This tells the software library that you are using a gesture sensor and that you
have plugged in into an I2C port.
You must call this function before anything else will work.


=== Get Gesture Reading


[source, language=C++]
----
/**
Reads gesture sensor and returns value of gesture (or 0 if no gesture detected)
	For more info see: http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Gesture_v1.0/

@returns	data = 0 if no gesture detected, otherwise the value of one of the CONSTANT VARIABLE VALUES below
	Up Gesture, data = GES_UP_FLAG
	Down Gesture, data = GES_DOWN_FLAG
	Left Gesture, data = GES_LEFT_FLAG
	Right Gesture, data = GES_RIGHT_FLAG
	Forward Gesture, data = GES_FORWARD_FLAG
