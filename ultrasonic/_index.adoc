== Software

Functions that interact with the ultrasonic ranger are prefixed with `ultra`.


=== Initialization

To prepare the software library to use the ultrssonic ranger, first call the
`ultraInit` function, telling it which pin it is connected to:

[source, language=C++]
----

/**
 * Prepare the ultrasonic distance sensor for use.
 *
 * @param    digitalPin   pin the chain is connected to (e.g., 4 for D4)
 */
void ultraInit(int digitalPin);
----


=== Get distance control

To retrieve the measured distance in centimeters, call `ultraGetDist()`:

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
 * Get the distance reading from the ultrasonic sensor
 *
 * @return	distance in cm (range of 0 - 400 cm)
 *
 */
long ultraGetDist();
