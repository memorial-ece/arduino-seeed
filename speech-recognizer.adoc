== Software

Functions that interact with the speech recognizer are prefixed with `speech`.


=== Initialization

To prepare the software library to use the speech recognizer, first call the
`speechInit` function, telling it which pin it is connected to:

[source, language=C++]
----
/**
Required to initialize speech recognizer

@param	pin Digital port to which component is connected

*/
void speechInit(int pin);
----


=== Get voice command

When using the speech recognizer, we need to use the keyword "Hicell" to 'wake' the component; the red LED will light. We can say one of 22 commands that will be recognized, and the corresponding value will be returned when `speechGetCommand()` is called.
